## Structure

### Evaluation

This software evaluates exactly like the previous, excel-based mechanism:
First, all outcomes of a game are fetched. Then the outcomes are separated by gender and sorted by better time or more points. Finally, points are assigned based on the resulting order, stating at 50.
Note that every gender is rated separately. The staring-point for rating can also be adjusted.

## Running
